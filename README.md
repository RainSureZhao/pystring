Pystring is a collection of C++ functions which match the interface and behavior of python's string 
class methods using std::string. Implemented in C++, it does not require or make use of a python interpreter.
It provides convenience and familiarity for common string operations not included in the standard C++ library.
It's also useful in environments where both C++ and python are used.

The project is referred to in the project: [pystring](https://github.com/imageworks/pystring)

Compared to the original project, use C++ 17 implementation, and use CMake to build the project.
